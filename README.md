We know that Attendance Percentage is strictly observed by the Administration before they give students the
permission to write the exams. Since it is a very important aspect there should be no mistakes in regarding to
a studentâ€™s attendance. In order to make the Attendance system work with more accuracy we came up with this
website. The website aims to simplify the process of Tracking Attendance of Students and our website enables
Students to check their attendance percentage on a daily basis. The website holds the information of all the students
and the faculty and the courses and sections being taught by the faculty. By using this system Institutions can
automate the attendance related tasks easily and save time and resources. The website facilitates the efficient
management of the attendance related data. The website enables the faculty to login to their account and select
their respective course for a particular section and give attendance to the students present. It keeps record of the
students present or absent for a course based on date, section, branch and year.
